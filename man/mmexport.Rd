\title{Export DNA sequences of selected scaffolds}
\usage{
mmexport(scaffolds, assembly = get("assembly", envir = .GlobalEnv),
  file = "exported_assembly.fa")
}
\arguments{
\item{scaffolds}{(\emph{required}) Either a vector of scaffold names or a dataframe loaded with \code{\link{mmload}} containing the scaffolds to extract from the \code{assembly}.}

\item{assembly}{(\emph{required}) The assembly to subset and export. Must be an object of class \code{"DNAStringSet"} as loaded with \code{\link[Biostrings]{readDNAStringSet}}. By default any object named "assembly" in the global environment will be used.}

\item{file}{The file path and file name of the file to write the sequences to. (\emph{Default: } \code{"exported_assembly.fa"})}
}
\description{
Writes the DNA sequences of a set of scaffolds from the assembly to a FASTA file.
