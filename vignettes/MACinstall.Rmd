title: "Installing mmgenome2 on MAC"
---

One of the dependencies ([Rtsne](https://github.com/jkrijthe/Rtsne/tree/openmp)) that `mmgenome2` uses requires the following to be able to compile and install correctly on MAC:

 - Open a terminal (cmd+space and type "terminal")
 - Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (a software manager for OSX) as described on the website [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/) 
 - run `brew uninstall gcc`
 - run `brew install gcc --without-multilib`
 - create a `.R` folder in your home directory by `mkdir ~/.R` 
 - create a `Makevars` file in the folder by `nano ~/.R/Makevars` and paste the following, save the file afterwards by ctrl+x followed by "y":

```r
CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-7
CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++-7
CXX1X=/usr/local/bin/g++-7
CXX11=/usr/local/bin/g++-7
SHLIB_CXXLD=/usr/local/bin/g++-7
FC=/usr/local/bin/gfortran-7
F77=/usr/local/bin/gfortran-7
MAKE=make -j8

SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS=-fopenmp
SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS=-fopenmp
SHLIB_OPENMP_FCFLAGS=-fopenmp
SHLIB_OPENMP_FFLAGS=-fopenmp
```

Now `mmgenome2` can be installed normally as described at the [mmgenome2 webpage](../index.html). If you have RStudio open then you must restart the current R-session (ctrl+shift+F10) before installing `mmgenome2`.
